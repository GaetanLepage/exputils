Current version: 0.2.21 (25/03/2022)

# Introduction

Experiment Utilities (exputils) contains various tools for the management of scientific experiments and their experimental data.
It is especially designed to handle experimental repetitions, including to run different repetitions, to effectively store and load data for them, and to visualize their results.  
 
Main features:
* Easy definition of default configurations using nested python dictionaries.
* Setup of experimental configuration parameters using an ODF file.
* Running of experiments and their repetitions locally or on clusters.
* Logging of experimental data (numpy, json).
* Loading and filtering of experimental data.
* Interactive Jupyter widgets to load, select and plot data as line, box and bar plots.

## <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

Developed and tested for Python 3.6, and the Linux OS (developed under Ubuntu 18.04).

Needs several additional python packages which will be automatically installed during the installation:
* numpy >= 1.19.5
* six >= 1.15.0
* ipywidgets >= 7.5.1
* qgrid >= 1.3.1
* plotly >= 4.13.0
* cloudpickle >= 1.6.0
* dill >= 0.3.3
* odfpy >= 1.4.1
* tabulate >= 0.8.9
* scipy >= 1.5.4

## Installation

__1) Exputils Package__

Clone via Git or download the current version of the exputils library.
Open the library in the console.  

To install the library:

`pip install .`

(To install the library as a developer so that changes to its source code are directly usable in other projects:
`pip install -e .`)

For using Jupyter GUIs with Jupyter Notebook, run the following command.
(Note: The GUI is currently only tested for Jupyter notebooks. For Jupyterlab, other installation procedures are necessary.)

`jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix qgrid`

I recommend to use the [Jupyter Notebooks Extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) to allow for example code folding or folding of headlines.
Install the extensions with these commands:

`pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions` \
`jupyter contrib nbextension install --user`

__2) Commands__

Several commands exist which make it easier to run experiments.
These commands are located in the *./commands/* directory.
These commands have to be adjusted for each project to your local machine and possible external machines or clusters.
Each project has a configuration file in the *./projects/* directory.

Create a copy of the script *TEMPLATE* and name it after your project *<project_name>*.
Then adjust the environment varibales in this file according to your local settings and external settings.
 
Add the following lines to your *~/.bashrc* to add the commands to the PATH and to load environment varibles of your default project:
 
    # define path to the exputils folder
    PATH_TO_EXPUTILS="<Path to exputils library, for example /home/user/code/exputils>"
    if [ -f "$PATH_TO_EXPUTILS/commands/eu_setup.sh" ] ; then
            . "$PATH_TO_EXPUTILS/commands/eu_setup.sh" "$PATH_TO_EXPUTILS"
    fi
    # set default project for exputils commands
    export EU_DEFAULT_PRJ=<name of your default project>
    # activate the default project
    source eu_activate

# <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Besides the exputils library (the python package) the project also contains example code and unit tests. 
It is recommended to look at these items to learn about the usage of the exputils components. 

The exputils package has the following structure:
 - **manage**: Managing of experiments. Generation of code for experiments and repetitions from ODS configurations and source templates. Running of experiments and repetitions (can be used to run experiments on clusters.)   
 - **data**: Logging and loading of experimental data including filtering of data. 
 - **gui**: GUI components for Jupyter to load and plot experimental data.
 - **misc**: Miscellaneous helper functions.
 - **io**: Input-output functions to save and load data of various formats, including numpy and json.

Experiments are stored in a specific folder structure which allows to save and load experimental data in a structured manner.
Please note that  it represents a default structure which can be adapted if required.
Elements in brackets (\<custom name>\) can have custom names.   
Folder structure:
 * **\<main\>** folder: Holds several experimental campaigns. A campaign holds experiments of the same kind but with different parameters.
    * **analyze** folder: Scripts such as Jupyter notebooks to analyze the different experimental campaigns in this main-folder.
    * **\<experimental campaign\>** folders:
        * **analyze** folder: Scripts such as Jupyter notebooks to analyze the different experiments in this experimental campaign. 
        * **experiment_configurations.ods** file: ODS file that contains the configuration parameters of the different experiments in this campaign.
        * **src** folder: Holds code templates of the experiments.
            * **\<repetition code\>** folders: Code templates that are used under the repetition folders of th experiments. These contain the acutal experimental code that should be run.
            * **\<experiment code\>** folders: Code templates that are used under the experiment folder of the experiment. These contain usually code to compute statistics over all repetitions of an experiment.
        * **generate_code.sh** file: Script file that generates the experimental code under the **experiments** folder using the configuration in the **experiment_configurations.ods** file and the code under the **src** folder.               
        * **experiments** folder: Contains generated code for experiments and the collected experimental data.
            * **experiment_{id}** folders:
                * **repetition_{id}** folders:
                    * **data** folder: Experimental data for the single repetitions, such as logs.
                    * code files: Generated code and resource files.
                * **data** folder: Experimental data for the whole experiment, e.g. statistics that are calculated over all repetitions.   
                * **\<code\>** files: Generated code and resource files.
        * **\<run scripts\>.sh** files: Various shell scripts to run experiments and calculate statistics locally or on clusters.
